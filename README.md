## Hi, I'm Hyunmo Yang

🎓 I majored in Computer Science at [SeoulTech](https://en.seoultech.ac.kr/),
graduated in Febuary 2025

📱 Until March 2025, I worked on Flutter development, contributing to
[Thunder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thunder-%EC%8D%AC%EB%8D%94-%EB%88%88%EB%B0%94%EB%94%94-%EC%B8%A1%EC%A0%95-%EC%95%B1/id6741709470),
published on App Stores as a team member.

🧑🏻‍💻 Currently building projects with Go and Python (especially love Go!) and
aiming to work as a software engineer.

⚙️ I enjoy tweaking my dev environment, including
[Neovim setup](https://github.com/yanmoyy/nvim-config) (btw) and
[dotfiles](https://github.com/yanmoyy/dotfiles).

🚀 See my last project, [Go-Go-Go](https://github.com/yanmoyy/go-go-go): Terminal-based Multiplayer Stone Shooting Game.
